Hack a mainframe. (a cool alias for ssh)

## How to hack a mainframe:

 1. Download this application by typing `npm install -g hack-mainframe`
 
 2. After this finishes downloading, pick a target, and hack it, by typing `hack-mainframe xxx@yyy`. Usage is the same as openSSH :)
 
 3. Hack responsibly.
